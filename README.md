# Datafusion Query Cache

**WIP this project is very early.**

Crate to cache the intermediate results of queries on timeseries data in DataFusion.

What's supported:
* [x] `GROUP BY` aggregation queries with a static lower bound
* [x] Aggregation queries (no `GROUP BY`) with a static lower bound
* [ ] Simple filter queries, should be simple enough
* [ ] `GROUP BY` aggregation queries with a dynamic lower bound (e.g . `timestamp > now() - interval '1 day'`) - this requires a `FilterExec` wrapping the `UnionExec` and discarding older data
* [ ] Aggregation queries (no `GROUP BY`) with a dynamic lower bound - this is harder, we probably have to rewrite the aggregation to include a `group_by` clause, then filter, then aggregate again???

## How to use

`datafusion-query-cache` is implemented via implementations of
[`QueryPlanner`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/execution/context/trait.QueryPlanner.html),
[`OptimizerRule`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/optimizer/trait.OptimizerRule.html),
[`UserDefinedLogicalNodeCore`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/logical_expr/trait.UserDefinedLogicalNodeCore.html) and
[`ExecutionPlan`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/trait.ExecutionPlan.html)

Usage is as simple as calling `with_query_cache`, here's a complete (if minimal) example of creating `SessionContext`:

```rs
async fn session_ctx() -> SessionContext {
    let state_builder = SessionStateBuilder::new()
        .with_config(SessionConfig::new())
        .with_runtime_env(Arc::new(RuntimeEnv::default()))
        .with_default_features();

    // records.timetamp is the default (and only) temporal column to look at
    let temporal_col = Column::new(Some("records".to_string()), "timestamp".to_string());

    // create an in memory cache for the query results
    // (in reality, you'd want to impl the `QueryCache` trait and store the data somewhere persistent)
    let cache = Arc::new(datafusion_query_cache::MemoryQueryCache::default());

    // create the query cache config
    let query_cache_config = datafusion_query_cache::QueryCacheConfig::new(temporal_col, cache)
        .with_group_by_function("date_trunc");

    // call with_query_cache to register the planners and optimizers
    let state_builder = datafusion_query_cache::with_query_cache(state_builder, query_cache_config);
    SessionContext::new_with_state(state_builder.build())
}
```

See [`examples/demo.rs](./examples/demo.rs) for a more complete working example.


## How it works (the very quick version)

Let's say you run the query:

```sql
SELECT max(price) FROM stock_prices WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' and timestamp > '2021-01-01'
```

Then 10 minutes later you run the same query â€” by default DataFusion will chunk through every
of of the millions of record in the `stock_prices` table again to find the result.

But it's obvious we could save a lot of time by remembering the result of the first query,
then combining it with a query on the last 10 minutes of data to get a result.

**That's what `datafusion-query-cache` does!**

## How it works (the (slightly) longer version)

Some people reading the above example will already being asking

> But combining max values is easy (you just take the max of the maxes), what about more complex queries?
> If we had used `avg` instead of `max` you can't combine to averages by just averaging them.

The best bit is: DataFusion already has all the machinery to combine queries, so `datafusion-query-cache`
doesn't need any special logic for different aggregations, indeed it doesn't even know what they are.

Instead we just hook into the right place in the physical plan to provide the cached results, constrain the query
on new data and store the new result.

Here's how it works: The physical plan for

```sql
SELECT avg(price) FROM stock_prices WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' and timestamp > '2021-01-01'
```

looks something like this (lots of details omitted):

```rs
AggegateExec {
    mode: Final,
    aggr_expr: [Avg(price)],
    input: AggegateExec {
        mode: Parital,
        aggr_expr: [Avg(price)],
        input: FilterExec {
            predicate: (symbol = 'AAPL' and timestamp > '2021-01-01'),
            input: TableScanExec {
                table: stock_prices
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how the `input` for the top level `AggegateExec` is another `AggegateExec`?
That's DataFusion allowing parallel execution by splitting the data into chunks and aggregating them separately.
The output of the inner `AggegateExec` looks like this (note `mode: Parital`):

| `avg(price)[count]` | `avg(price)[sum]` |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 123.4               | 1000              |
| 125.4               | 1000              |
| 127.4               | 1000              |

The top level `AggegateExec` with (`mode: Final`), then combines these partial results to get the final answer.

This "combine partial results" is exactly what `datafusion-query-cache` ues to combine the cached result with the new data.

So `datafusion-query-cache`, would rewrite the above query to have the following physical plan:

```rs
AggegateExec {
    mode: Final,
    aggr_expr: [Avg(price)],
    input: CacheUpdateAggregateExec {  // wrap the partial aggegations and stores the result for later
        input: UnionExec {
            inputs: [
                AggegateExec {  // compute aggegates for the new data
                    mode: Parital,
                    aggr_expr: [Avg(price)],
                    input: FilterExec {
                        predicate: ((symbol = 'AAPL' and timestamp > '2021-01-01') and timestamp < '{last run}'),
                        input: TableScanExec {
                            table: stock_prices
                        }
                    }
                },
                CachedAggregateExec {  // get the cached result
                    cache_key: "SELECT avg(price)...",
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
